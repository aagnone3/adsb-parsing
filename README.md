# ADSB Data Parsing

A collection of Python scripts which server to parse ADSB data commonly transmitted by aircraft. Currently, two sources of ADSB data are supported:
- [Virtual Radar Server](http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/) 
- [ADSB Hub](http://www.adsbhub.net/)


# Motivation

I came across [this site](https://www.flightradar24.com) and just got giddy. I now have a Raspberry Pi 3 feeding ADSB data to [ADSB hub](http://www.adsbhub.net/), which in returns gets me the combined feed from all similar data providers. But now we need to parse this data in order to do nerdy things with it! Bingo: here's the code.

# Installation

Clone and run! This is a lightweight repository that does not need any formal installation.
